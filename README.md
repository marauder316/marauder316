This is gonna change as time goes along, I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing, so... uhh...
Here's my stats, I hope they'll improve as I learn new languages n' stuff:

![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=marauder316&show_icons=true&theme=gruvbox)

### Rices

## Manjaro
![*Near-default i3 Edition config; my favourite so far!*](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/635625917623828520/811784187677507624/Manjaro-i3-Showcase.png)
Not much to say 'bout this one.

## Modern-Themed CrOS Rice
![*I'd definitely live here*](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/635625917623828520/810976344422350929/Screenshot_2021-02-15_2.44.47_PM.png)
Basically what it sounds like; I managed to get oh-my-zsh installed with a slightly modified "Darkblood" theme. Pardon the French in the song, "Grown Man Sport" by Pete Rock and InI.

## R33 GT-R Rice
![*Yus*](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/808529781179547648/809232162821505064/CrOS-R33-Rice-Kukui.png)
Wallpaper's a burnt orange Nissan  BNR-33 Skyline GT-R
This IS NOT Debian, it's a Debian Crostini container. The whole thing was set up before I knew about Chromebrew.

## Crostini Rice
![*I made so many blunders on this one...*](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/635625917623828520/802775472798433340/unknown.png)
Just a misc. rice I made after looking at some wallpapers I had.
